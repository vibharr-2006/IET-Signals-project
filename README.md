# IET-Signals-project

This project demonstrates how to clean a noisy audio signal using FIR and IIR filters, and how to detect transient events such as hand claps in the audio.

## Features

- Load and process noisy audio recordings
- Apply FIR and IIR low-pass filters
- Visualize time-domain and frequency-domain signals
- Detect transient sounds like claps or taps
- Used features like short time energy and band energy ratio for detection

## Technologies Used

- Python 3
- NumPy
- SciPy
- Matplotlib
- SoundFile
